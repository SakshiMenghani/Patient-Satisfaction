**Description**

The HCAHPS Patient Satisfaction Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project that analyzes and presents patient satisfaction metrics for hospitals in the United States. Leveraging a combination of SQL and Tableau, this project aims to provide insights into how satisfied patients are with their hospital experiences, based on data from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey.

**Key Features:**

**Data Source:** The project utilizes the HCAHPS dataset, which includes over 3000 hospitals in the United States and various patient satisfaction metrics such as survey responses, response rates, and hospital information.

**Interactive Dashboard:** The Tableau dashboard offers an intuitive and interactive interface for users to explore patient satisfaction metrics across different hospitals. Users can filter and drill down into specific hospitals, regions, or satisfaction metrics to gain deeper insights.

**Visualization:** The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and maps, to present key metrics such as patient satisfaction scores, survey response rates, and hospital performance over time.

**Hospital Comparison:** Users can compare multiple hospitals side by side to identify trends, patterns, and performance differences across different facilities.

**Calculation Metrics:** The project includes calculated metrics such as hospital size, actual survey response rate, and hospital completeness, which provide additional context and insights into the data.

The HCAHPS Patient Satisfaction Dashboard provides an insightful analysis of hospital performance and patient satisfaction metrics across the United States. Featuring five dynamic tiles, the dashboard offers an interactive exploration of key indicators without user-filtering options.

**Rating Hospital 9/10:**
This tile showcases the percentage of hospitals rated 9/10 or higher based on patient satisfaction scores. Users can assess the distribution of highly-rated hospitals across different categories such as HCAHPS answers, hospital size, and completeness without the ability to filter specific parameters.

**Survey Responses:**
Users can delve into survey response rates across hospitals through this tile. The analysis includes insights into factors influencing response rates such as hospital size, state, and hospital check, allowing users to understand engagement levels without filtering options.

**Number of Completed Surveys:**
This tile presents the total number of completed surveys for each hospital. Users can gauge participation levels and the representativeness of data without the option to filter specific parameters.

**Question Delta from Mean Cohort:**
Users can explore hospital performance relative to the mean cohort for specific HCAHPS questions in this tile. While unable to apply filters, users can identify areas of excellence or improvement across hospitals based on answer descriptions and other predefined parameters.

**Cohort Hospital Delta Squared:**
This tile offers insights into hospital performance differentials through squared delta calculations. Users can examine performance variations among hospitals based on answer descriptions and question deltas without filter capabilities.

**Summary Dashboard**
The HCAHPS Patient Satisfaction Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital performance and patient satisfaction metrics across the United States. Through five dynamic tiles, the dashboard offers insights into the percentage of hospitals rated 9/10 or higher, survey response rates, total completed surveys, hospital performance relative to the mean cohort, and performance differentials among hospitals. Users can explore trends and patterns in patient satisfaction without the ability to apply specific filters, gaining insights into factors influencing hospital ratings and survey participation. The dashboard enables stakeholders to benchmark hospital performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance healthcare quality and patient experiences nationwide.
